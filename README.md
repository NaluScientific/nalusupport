# Developers

## Setup

This website is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator.

To install Jekyll, follow the instructions [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/). It is highly recommended to run
your development environment on Linux or macOS.

## Running Locally

To run the website locally, run the following command in the root directory of this repository:

```sh
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

The website will be available at `http://localhost:4000` by default. The `--port` option can be used to specify a different port.
